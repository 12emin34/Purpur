Purpur documentation
====================

.. warning::
    This documentation is a work in progress. Some things are still missing. If
    you'd like to see it completed faster, you can contribute to the documentation
    `here <https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur>`_.

Welcome to the official documentation source for the
`Purpur <https://www.github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur>`__ project.

Purpur is a fork of Paper used by the Pl3xCraft server. It contains many gameplay
changes to suit our server that are deemed too wild to be included directly upstream into Paper.
